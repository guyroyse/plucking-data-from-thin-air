# packet-watcher

From this folder, you need to run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will transpile and install the `packet-watcher` tool globaly on your system. To run it you will first need to run `direwolf` in another terminal and then `packet-watcher`:

```bash
rtl_fm -M fm -f 144.39M -E dc | direwolf -
```
